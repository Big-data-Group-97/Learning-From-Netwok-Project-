# Plan after porposal submission

## step 0 - Prof Feedback
Consider prof feedback
Resources and advice are very welcome

## step 1 - Problem Identification
Details matter, give proper definitions
- graph type and properties
- metrics of damage
- type of damage
No algorithm design, only work on problem identification and definition
Identify, classify and rank, will have to compare and select best fits for project
Develop individually first, compare and choose the best candidates later

## step 2 - Basic Literature Review
Consider present literature
Consult materials that might cover the topic
- books
- papers
- online resources
- professors advice
Identify potential preexisting framework to take advantage of
No need for deep research, just verifying presence or not of preexisting research and taking advantage of common work
The more there is, the less theoretical work we need to do
Documet all research and sources
Research individually, compare often and share resources

## step 3 - Further Discussion
When problem definition and literature review complete, meet to discuss future steps
- Consider time spent and remaining before midterm 
- Need to define target problem characteristics and block
- consider need of more theoretical research
- Consider talking with the professor
- potential start of work towards first algorithm designs and implementation

# Problem definition
 - type of graph
   - weighted/unweighted
   - directed/undirected
   - edge propertioes/limits
   - node proeprties/limits
   - more
 - definitioon of damage
   - node removed
   - weight altered
   - linked edges removed
     - all/some
   - properties altered
 - metric of effect
   - number of edges removed
   - changes to shortes path pairs
     - length/weight/number of changes
   - isolation of communities
     - fragility of community connection
 - number of nodes removed

Idenitfy possibilituies for all these, consider varipus copmbinations and choose a few (3-6) specific types
Compare with colleagues and choose 2-4 for nect steps
