Title: WORKING NOTES FOR LfN PROJECT - Percolation Theory and Network Robustness
---

# Plan for final version

Book covers broadly and quickly multiple topics:

- random attacks on meshes
- random attacks on random networks
- random attacks on real networks
- percolation theory for all these
- targeted attacks on real networks 
- targeted attacks on random networks
- cascading phenomenon 
- making networks robust 

Plan is to:

- find relevant dataset
- apply algorithms for random attacks and targeted attacks to verify books theory 
- write about experience of reconstructing the work 
- restructure theory into shorter text for paper 

Plan:
    On Random attacks:
    - Martino: rework text and create report section 
    - Lorenzo & Pier: find dataset and construct random attacks on real and random networks 
    - consult on workload and time needed
    On Real attacks:
    If done quickly, move to advanced topic

Advanced Topic:
- how to ensure robustness
